    "* create and call user-defined functions\n",
    "* create 2D line and scatter plots\n",
    "* choose appropriate resolution for line plots\n",

Let the function take the parameters $A$, $\\omega_{0}$ and $\\beta$ as inputs, as well as time $t$. Then plot your function versus time. Experiment with different parameter values (while keeping $\\omega_{0}>\\beta$) and time ranges. Construct a reasonably smooth plot with the recognizable behavior of a damped oscillator.
