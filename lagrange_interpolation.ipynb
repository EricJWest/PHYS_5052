    "Suppose we are given values of some function $f(x_{0}),\\ldots,f(x_{n})$, at the points $x_{0},\\ldots,x_{n}$. The function $f(x)$ itself may be unknown to us. For example it might represent some empirical relationship that we only have in tabulated form. Alternatively, $f(x)$ might be a function we know the name of, but it might be computationally expensive to calculate at arbitrary points. Whatever the case, assume we need to approximate the function $f(x)$ by a polynomial $p(x)$ that exactly passes through the given $n+1$ points. This procedure is called interpolation.\n",
