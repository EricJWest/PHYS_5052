    "Suppose we are given values of some function $f(x_{0}),\\ldots,f(x_{n})$, at the points $x_{0},\\ldots,x_{n}$. The function $f(x)$ itself may be unknown to us. For example it might represent some empirical relationship that we only have in tabulated form. Alternatively, $f(x)$ might be a function we know the name of, but it might be computationally expensive to calculate at arbitrary points. Whatever the case, assume we need to approximate the function $f(x)$ by a polynomial $p(x)$ that exactly passes through the given $n+1$ points. This procedure is called interpolation.\n",

    "NOTE: Here we are only considering a specific form of polynomial interpolation, called \"Lagrange interpolation\", for the sake of illustration. There are other forms of interpolation (Hermite, cubic spline, etc) that are sometimes more appropriate. We will say more about interpolation later in the course. For now, just try to get the gist of what is going on in this special case.\n",
